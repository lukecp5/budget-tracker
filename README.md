# Budget Tracker
Budget Tracker is a full-stack application built with Node.js, Express, MongoDB & Atlas, Heroku, and IndexedDB. This application stores all of your transactions on a Mongo Atlas database to calculate your current balance. Based on all of your past transactions, the application will create a graph for you that will allow you to see the amount of money in your budget over time. 

This application is a Progressive Web App, so it can be installed on your computer like any other native application. Simply add the page to your home page if you're on a mobile phone, or create a shortcut to the application on a computer and you will receive an icon on your desktop or home page. Once that icon is on your homepage, you can use the Budget Tracker anytime(with or without an internet connection) to track your budget. The Budget Tracker application acts like a standalone application so that you don't have to have the bulk of your internet browser when using the app.
